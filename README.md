# go-count

I'm going to build counter service with following features. Main purpose is to learn how to build go service from sratch and find best way how to deliver it to the production.

- [X] HTTP endpoint response with increasing number on every call
- [ ] Tests ðŸ‘»
- [ ] JSON logging with verbosity level
- [ ] Reset request
- [ ] Database backend to preserve counter during restart
- [ ] CI
- [ ] Automated deployment/rollout to Kubernetes
